These numbers represent the altitudes. This application will count the number of “hills” while you are entering a number. A hill is made up of at least three different altitudes, in which these numbers must go up and then come down. Additionally, a plateau (flat surface) can exist on the top of and anywhere on the hill, where all the numbers are the same.
