    /// Create a console app that lets you input a sequence of integers until the end of line with CTRL-Z. Each iteration will calculate and display all the averages that have been recalculated (when the logic is satisfied) of all the consecutive and positive numbers on separate lines. Round this average to the nearest 100th with thousands-commas and zero-paddings (i.e. use "N2" format); for example, display 6,666,666.67 but not 6666666.66666... However, this special average must include no more than one smallest number of the consecutive sequence of numbers and no more than one largest number of the consecutive sequence of numbers. That is, the sum cannot contain any repeated number that is either the largest or the smallest number.
