    /// Create a console application that lets you enter a bunch of integers until it has reached the end with CTRL-Z. When the app exits, the app will simply print out the "centered" average of all the values entered. We'll say that the centered average is the mean average of the values by neglecting the largest and smallest values in the array. If there are multiple copies of the smallest value, ignore just one copy, and likewise for the largest value. Use int division to produce the final average. You may assume that the number of inputs is at least 3.
